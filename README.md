# Reverse Proxy for Airbnb Clones

This proxy was built to bring together several cloned Airbnb apps into a single page in a service-oriented architecture fashion. Using Node and Express, the proxy reroutes requests to the correct service endpoints, and serves a small React app which organizes UI elements on the page.
